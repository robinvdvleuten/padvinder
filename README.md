*Padvinder* is Dutch for "pathfinder", and also what we call a scout. It implements RFC 9535 JSONPath, filters included, with a real parser instead of the generated code that filter evaluation usually relies on. There is no `eval` and no `new Function`, so a query cannot smuggle code into your application, and the engine runs under a strict Content Security Policy.

```js
import { query, find } from 'padvinder';

const data = {
  store: {
    book: [
      { title: 'Sayings of the Century', price: 8.95, category: 'reference' },
      { title: 'Sword of Honour', price: 12.99, category: 'fiction' },
      { title: 'Moby Dick', price: 8.99, category: 'fiction' },
    ],
  },
};

// One-shot:
find('$..book[?@.price < 10].title', data);
// => ['Sayings of the Century', 'Moby Dick']

// Compile once, run many times:
const cheap = query('$.store.book[?@.price < 10 && @.category == "fiction"].title');
cheap(data); // => ['Moby Dick']

// Register your own filter functions:
find('$..book[?sale(@)].title', data, { sale: b => b.price < 9 });
```

## API

### `query(path, functions?, options?)`

Compiles the query and returns a runner `(data) => matches[]`. Malformed paths and invalid filter expressions throw a `SyntaxError` at compile time. A query that matches nothing returns an empty array.

The runner exposes deeply frozen compile-time metadata:

- `functions` lists referenced caller-registered filter extensions in first-seen order. RFC built-ins are excluded.
- `paths` lists deduplicated dependency topologies for the main query and embedded `$`/`@` filter queries. Each path is an anchor-first tuple followed by selector tuples such as `['name', 'store']`, `['index', 0]`, `['wildcard']`, `['union', ...selectors]`, `['slice', start, end, step]`, `['filter']`, or `['descendant', selector]`.

Dynamic tuples describe selection topology, not exact field locations or a lossless query AST. Filter predicate text and parent links for embedded queries are intentionally omitted; selector order and union duplicates are preserved.

The runner also exposes `isDiagnostic(error)`. This narrower predicate returns `true` only for runtime traversal-budget errors created by that compiled runner. Repeated calls share the runner origin; another runner, even from the same module instance, does not authenticate the error.

### `find(path, data, functions?, options?)`

Shorthand for `query(path, functions)(data)`.

Traversal budgets are optional host controls. Without them, queries remain unlimited. `maxNodes` bounds locations visited across the main query and filter subqueries, `maxDepth` bounds child edges from each query start at depth zero, and `maxResults` bounds the final nodelist of each main or embedded query:

```js
const options = { maxNodes: 10_000, maxDepth: 64, maxResults: 1_000 };
find('$..book[*]', data, {}, options);
```

Each value must be a non-negative safe integer. Exceeding a budget throws a `RangeError` with `code`, `limit`, and `actual` properties. Codes are `PADVINDER_MAX_NODES`, `PADVINDER_MAX_DEPTH`, and `PADVINDER_MAX_RESULTS`. A compiled runner starts with fresh counters on every call.

Errors created by padvinder keep their `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, or `RangeError` class. Use the exported `isDiagnostic(error)` to authenticate package origin. The check is local to one installed module instance: copied properties and errors from another copy do not pass. It covers compile-time diagnostics, for which no runner is returned, and runtime diagnostics from every runner in that module instance.

Errors from caller-provided coercion hooks, accessors, or function extensions pass through unchanged. Package authentication still identifies where an error was created when caller code rethrows an authentic padvinder diagnostic, while `runner.isDiagnostic(error)` rejects it unless that runner created the runtime fault. The one-shot `find()` API does not expose its temporary runner; use `query()` when runner-scoped authentication is required.

## Syntax

| Selector | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `$` | The root |
| `.name`, `['name']` | Child property |
| `[0]`, `[-1]` | Array index, negatives count from the end |
| `[1:3]`, `[:2]`, `[-2:]`, `[0:4:2]` | Array slice, with optional positive step |
| `.*`, `[*]` | All children |
| `..name` | Recursive descent: `name` anywhere below |
| `[0,2]`, `['a','b']` | Union of selectors |
| `[?expr]`, `[?(expr)]` | Keep children matching the filter (see below) |

## Filters

Filters follow the RFC 9535 grammar. Comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), the logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!`, and parentheses combine two kinds of operand: literals and *queries*. A bare query is an existence test, so `[?@.a]` keeps children that have an `a`, including a present `null`. A query used in a comparison is read for its value, and a missing path compares as "nothing" rather than throwing, so `[?@.a.b == 1]` is safe even when `a` is absent. `==` is deep structural equality.

```js
find('$.store.book[?@.price < 10]', data);
find('$.store.book[?@.price > $.store.bicycle.price]', data);           // $ is the root
find('$.store.book[?@.category == "fiction" && @.price < 20]', data);
find('$.store.book[?!@.sale]', data);
```

Five functions ship built in: `length()`, `count()`, `value()`, and the regular-expression tests `match()` (full match) and `search()` (substring). Register your own for anything else, and call them from a filter with `@` as the current node:

```js
find('$.book[?length(@.title) > 20]', data);
find('$.book[?match(@.isbn, "[0-9]{13}")]', data);
find('$.book[?luhn(@.code)]', data, { luhn: valid });                   // your function
```

`match()` and `search()` use [treffer](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/treffer), a bounded [RFC 9485 I-Regexp](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9485.html) Thompson-NFA matcher. Matching does not backtrack. `^` and `$` are supported as anchors for compatibility with the JSONPath compliance suite. JavaScript-only syntax such as `\d`, lookarounds, backreferences, and lazy quantifiers is rejected; use `[0-9]` in place of `\d`.

Treffer enforces its documented pattern, subject, NFA, and work limits. padvinder authenticates errors created by Treffer and maps its syntax and resource diagnostics to no match, as required by RFC 9535. Unexpected errors are not misclassified or swallowed. See [Treffer's documentation](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/treffer#errors-and-limits) for the current codes, limits, and complexity bounds.

## Content Security Policy

padvinder works under `script-src 'self'` with no `unsafe-eval`. Paths and filters compile to a chain of closures. Query text is never turned into JavaScript.

This matters for JSONPath specifically because filter expressions are the classic weak spot: jsonpath-plus evaluated them by executing generated code, which led to remote code execution via crafted queries ([CVE-2024-21534](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21534)) and follow-up bypasses. padvinder parses filters and regular expressions without executing query text. The test suite runs under `node --disallow-code-generation-from-strings`, which throws on any string-to-code construct the same way a strict CSP does. See the [comparison benchmarks](bench/comparison/) for cold-compile and hot-run comparisons.

## Safety

- Queries read the data you pass in and never modify it.
- `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` never match, in paths or in filters. Prototype-chain properties are invisible: matching is own-properties only, so a filter like `[?@.constructor]` finds nothing rather than reaching `Object.prototype`.
- I-Regexp matching uses bounded NFA simulation instead of a backtracking engine.
- Registered functions resolve only from what you provide, and receive plain data values as arguments.

## Environments

Node.js 22 and newer are supported through the ESM and CommonJS builds. Browser use is supported through a standards-based ESM bundler in environments supporting ES2024. Direct `<script>` globals and UMD builds are not provided.
