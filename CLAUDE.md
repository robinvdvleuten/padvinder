# padvinder

Tiny, CSP-safe RFC 9535 JSONPath engine. Same family and toolchain as xprsn and sjabloon (plain JS + JSDoc, Node test runner, tsdown). The filter grammar lives here; bounded I-Regexp matching comes from treffer.

## Commands

- `npm run check` — the complete pull-request CI quality gate: build, size, unit and type tests (including compliance coverage), deterministic fuzz regression, and browser CSP.
- `npm test` — Node's built-in test runner under `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` (strict-CSP simulation), then `npm run test:types` (a smoke check that `index.d.ts` is usable, in `test/types.check.ts`). Keep this on Node: Bun accepts that V8 flag but does not enforce it.
- `npm run build` — tsdown (rolldown + oxc), configured in `tsdown.config.js` → `dist/` (ESM/CJS targeting ES2024). Type generation is off; `index.d.ts` is hand-written.
- `npm run size` — size-limit checks the gzip size of `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.cjs` against the budgets in `package.json`.
- `npm run test:browser` — builds the package and runs the browser bundle in Playwright Chromium under a strict CSP.
- Run a single suite: `node --disallow-code-generation-from-strings --test test/query.test.js`
- `npm run fuzz` — jazzer.js discovery over `compile`, `find`, `structured` targets in `fuzz/` (run against `src/` under `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings`); `npm run fuzz:regression` replays the committed corpus (the CI gate). See [fuzz/README.md](fuzz/README.md). `fuzz/` is not in `files`, so it is never published.

## Architecture

The entire implementation is `src/index.js` (~420 lines, one file by design). `segments(path, j, fns, soft)` parses consecutive segments into closures `(nodes, root) => nodes`; `run()` reduces them over a start nodelist. `query()` calls it in hard mode (`soft` false, errors on junk); the filter parser calls it in soft mode (stops at the first char that cannot start a segment) to parse embedded queries. No JSONPath AST, no code generation.

Bracket contents are scanned by `close()` (matching `]` with nesting and string awareness) and `split()` (top-level commas for unions). `child()`/`kids()` are the only data-access paths. Each segment carries a `sing` flag (singular: one name/index selector, not a descendant) that the filter parser uses to accept or reject a query in ValueType position.

Filters are RFC 9535, parsed by `rfcFilter()` in `selector()`'s `?` branch: a recursive-descent parser (`or`/`and`/`basic`/`primary`) producing `(node, root) => boolean`. Queries run through `segments()`+`run()`; a bare query is an existence test (nodelist length); `cmp()` implements RFC comparison (deep `==` via `deepEq`, `NOTHING` sentinel for absent singular queries, orderings only for same-typed number/string pairs). The five built-in function extensions live in `RFCFN` with arg/return typing; a name not in `RFCFN` is looked up in the caller's registry and treated as a function extension taking value-type args (usable as a value or as a truthiness test — the one deliberate step beyond strict RFC, and it never affects the compliance suite, which only exercises the built-ins). A genuinely malformed filter throws `SyntaxError` at compile time; there is no fallback.

`match()`/`search()` compile through treffer with `{ anchors: true }`. `reTest()` keeps a one-entry positive or negative cache so a document-supplied pattern compiles at most once while filtering a document. Treffer errors and resource-limit failures become false, preserving RFC function behavior.

## Hard constraints

1. **CSP safety is non-negotiable.** Same rules as the siblings: no string-to-code paths, the suite runs under `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings`, and a test scans the source — don't use the words "eval" or "new Function" even in comments.
2. **`child()`, `kids()`, and `deepEq()` are the access boundary.** All data reads go through them; each skips `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` and matches own properties only (`Object.hasOwn`). Never add a read path that bypasses them. Blocked keys silently match nothing everywhere (queries are search, not access), including inside filters — that is intentional and pinned by the safety suite.
3. **`rfcFilter()` is a parser over closures, not a source generator.** It builds `(node, root) => boolean` from pre-existing functions; it never emits or runs source text. It must consume the whole filter and throw `SyntaxError` on anything non-RFC — there is no fallback, so a malformed filter is a hard error, not a reinterpretation.
4. **Treffer is the only runtime dependency.** The JSONPath and filter grammars stay local. Do not add another parser or matcher dependency.
5. **I-Regexp execution must stay bounded.** Keep `match()`/`search()` on treffer with `{ anchors: true }`, preserve the one-entry negative cache and oversized-pattern retention guard, and convert matcher errors to false.
6. Queries must never modify the data (a test snapshots and compares).
7. Size is a soft goal (~3KB min+gzip, excluding treffer). The compliance suite (`npm run cts:update`) is the correctness gate, not size.

## Omakase pragmatism

Apply this across the whole project: implementation, API design, tests, documentation, dependencies, and tooling. Prefer cohesive defaults and one obvious path over knobs, abstraction, or infrastructure. Test the guarantee users rely on directly, and add complexity only when concrete pressure justifies it. These preferences never weaken the RFC or hard safety constraints.

## Semantics to preserve

- Non-matches return `[]`, never throw: missing keys, out-of-range indexes, wrong node types.
- Compile-time `SyntaxError` for malformed paths and filters. Filters never throw at runtime; a missing or blocked path is simply absent.
- Negative indexes count from the end; slices follow RFC 9535 (negative steps walk backwards, step 0 selects nothing).
- Bracket keys are RFC-typed: a quoted name selects only from objects, an index only from arrays.
- `..` applies the following segment to the node and every descendant, in document order; `all()` carries an ancestor set so cyclic data cannot hang it.
- RFC filters: existence is present-not-truthy (`[?@.a]` matches `{a: null}`), `==` is deep equality, absent singular queries are `NOTHING`. The compliance suite (`test/cts.json`, BSD-2, notice in `test/cts.LICENSE`) pins all of this; `test/compliance.test.js` must report 456 conformant with an empty `DIALECT` ledger.
- I-Regexp follows RFC 9485 plus CTS-compatible `^`/`$` anchors. JavaScript-only escapes and assertions are invalid and return no match. Matching iterates Unicode scalar values; lone surrogates and resource-limit failures return no match.

## Conventions

- Tabs for indentation. Tests use `node:test`: unit and compliance suites live in `test/*.test.js` (`query`, `errors`, `safety`, `compliance`), the type smoke check is `test/types.check.ts`, and browser fixtures live in `test/browser/`.
- Do not mention Symfony in code, comments, or docs.
- Runtime support is Node.js 22+ through ESM/CJS and ES2024 browser environments through a standards-based ESM bundler. There is no direct-script global or UMD build.
- Suggested commit messages must follow Conventional Commits and be at most 80 characters.
- `dist/` is gitignored build output. `index.d.ts` is **hand-written** (bundler type generation is off via `dts: false` in `tsdown.config.js`) — keep it in sync with the JSDoc in `src/index.js` by hand. `test/types.check.ts` (run by `npm run test:types`, part of `npm test`) is a smoke check that the declarations are usable.
- New path/filter syntax or safety guards must be reflected in the structured fuzz generator (`fuzz/structured.fuzz.js`): teach the generator the new form and add an oracle or fixed battery for any new invariant.
